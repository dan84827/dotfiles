# i3
I use regular i3 with some configurations here and there.
I also use i3blocks as the status bar because its simple.
I may try i3-gaps in the future.

# ranger
There's really not much configuration here

# tmux
There's a bunch of configuration here.

# urxvt
Lots of configuration here as well.

I think that the custom plugins I added are as follows:

Lots of configuration here as well.

### _Plugins:_

# xbdindkeys
Not much here, I just use it to remap capslock to escape.
It's useful for the laptop and stock keyboards, but not so much if you have a programmable  keyboard.

# zathura
My PDF reader of choice. It's amazing.
I think you can configure it to have tabs with a version called zathura-tabbed.

# zsh
My ternminal emulator of choice.

### _Plugins:_
- Oh-My-ZSH 
- zsh-syntax-highlighting
- zsh-autosuggestions
